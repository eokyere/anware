    <string name="about_text">Anware is Android Oware.

Oware is the one of the most well know versions of games in the Mancala family 
of abstract strategy games. The Mancala family of games involves moving and 
sowing seeds in pits, in order to capture seeds controlled by a player\'s 
opponent.

Oware is mostly played throughout West Africa and the Caribbean.</string>
		<string name="oware_rules">Starting: Each player takes it in turns to start. 
The player must then choose a house from their own territory, from which all 
the seeds are scooped.\n\n
Sowing: The seeds are then sown in an anticlockwise direction placing one 
seed in each house as one travel, around the board. If the last seed drops in a 
house with seeds in it, all the seeds are scooped up and then sown until ones 
last seed lands in a house, which is empty.\n\n
Capturing: Seeds are captured when the sowing of seeds by either player 
creates four seeds on ones territory. One can only capture seeds on ones own 
territory, except when four seeds are made with ones last seed on the 
opponent\'s territory. Once the seeds are captured they are placed in ones store.
